# MetaPlayer

**Class:** Utility

**Language:** Java

**Platform:** Windows / Linux

This is a utility program for managing large music playlists - too large to handle with many existing media players. It does not actually play the music itself, but instead calls existing media players for the different songs.

## Setup

Download our Toolbox-Java (which is a separate project here on github) into an adjacent directory on your hard drive.

Start the build by calling under Windows:

```
build.bat
```

Or under Linux:

```
build.sh
```

## Run

To start up the Meta Player project after it has been built, you can call under Windows:

```
run.bat
```

Or under Linux:

```
run.sh
```
